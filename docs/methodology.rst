Methodology
===========

FLEET uses a random forest algorithm to predict whether a transient is most likely to be a SLSN or a TDE, for details of the methods see the ApJ papers:

* [2]: `TDE paper <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023ApJ...949..113G>`_ describing the algorithm and its application to tidal disruption events (TDEs).
* [3]: `updated paper <https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.10811>`_ describing the first two years of operations in search for SLSNe.
